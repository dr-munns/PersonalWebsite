    <p>
      I'm currently teaching myself how to build websites and web-apps.
      This website here is one of my learning playgrouds.
      You can take a look at the code with a simple "ctr+u".
      Or you can take a look at my
      <a href = "https://github.com/dr-munns/PersonalWebsite/">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also there you will find the 1st working prototype code of the
      Task Management app I'm building to teach myself php and SQL.
      Though be warned, I didn't spend any time tweaking aesthetics.
      So mind your eyes.
