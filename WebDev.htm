      <p>
        I'm currently teaching myself how to build websites and web-apps.
        This website here is one of my learning playgrouds.
        You can take a look at the code with a simple "ctr+u".
        Or you can take a look at my
        <a href = "https://github.com/dr-munns/PersonalWebsite/">GitHub</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also there you will find the 1st working prototype code of the
        Task Management app I'm building to teach myself php and SQL.
        Though be warned, my goal was to learn about the back-end stuff so
        I didn't spend any time tweaking aesthetics.
        In other words, mind your eyes.
