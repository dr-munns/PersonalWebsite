      <p>
        I like to always have at least one creative project on the go, here I'm going to gather a collection.
        Both works in progress and finished articles.

        My main theatrical shenanigans have been with
        <a href="http://www.hereticalproductions.co.uk/">Heretical Productions</a>.
        We devise all our own work which is invariably funny, energetic and a little bit mad-cap.
        Check out that website for more details and pictures.
